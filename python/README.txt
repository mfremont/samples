cookieauth.py is a small utility module that I wrote to mint and validate
tamper-proof tokens for the purpose of cookie-based authentication in
a web app.

smcourt.py is a script I wrote to facilitate automated data mining of
the San Mateo Court Open Access system. It was originally created in 
order to make it feasible to search the court records for unlawful
detainer cases that had been filed by a large residential landlord
who filed these eviction cases under a variety of LLC names. It served
its purpose, allowing me to identify nearly 200 eviction cases filed
over a two-year period by this landlord.
